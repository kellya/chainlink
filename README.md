Chainlink
=========

Chainlink is a utility that will run on a webserver to handle crypto-backed domains.  Specifically this works with [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com)

Installation
============

To install this on your own server:

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Install the python dependancies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the server with `./chainlink.py`
4.  You can now hit the app at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000)

Testing on a running instance
=============================

Assuming that it is running (I could be messing with it, or it might just be
broken), you may try this without installing by going to
